# Project outline:
The project will setup with a group of people (the number of people can change by user). The environment is set on a mountain, there are some obstacles like trees and stones (the number of obstacles can change by user).  And also there is some safety zones, The Firebases (the number of safety zones can change by users). 
On the other hand, there are some bears that chasing people and want to haunt them (the number of bears can change by users). Some people may succeed to run away, some don’t. The people who are able to run away and reach to the firebases they can be sure that are safe from bears


# World And Turtles:
World : I used a real picture of a snowy mountain for The World  for a better looking. All the  turtles (the agents) are inside this world.
Turtles: different types of turtles I used in this project are listed as following:
•	Humans: the humans are wandering around the world and they try to run away from Bears.
•	Bears: bears are trying to haunt the humans.
•	Trees and Stones: These turtles are considered just as an obstacle for humans only. This obstacles does not affect bears ability to chase humans.
•	Firebases: this turtles are the safety zones.

# Buttons:
There are three different buttons on the screen:
•	Clear: it will clear all the element on the world.
•	Setup: Setup the program based on the setup procedure and user global variables.
•	Go: Simulate the app 

# Sliders:
There is seven different slider on the screen:
•	Numhumans: which is responsible to create humans based on user input. User can increase or decrease the numbers of human. 
•	Numbears: which is responsible to create Bears based on user input. User can increase or decrease the numbers of Bears.
•	Bears-speed: by default the bears can move 2 times faster than humans. Cause the speed of bears in reality is 60 and the maximum speed of a human is 30. User can change this value. 
•	Humans-speed: User can change the speed of movements of humans. 
•	Numtrees: which is responsible to create trees based on user input. User can increase or decrease the numbers of trees.
•	Numstones: which is responsible to create stones based on user input. User can increase or decrease the numbers of stones.
•	Numfirebases: which is responsible to create safety zone based on user input. User can increase or decrease the numbers of firebases.

# Monitors:
There is 9 monitor and one plot to show the analytics of the program.
•	Success: show the success rate, in other words it shows the count of humans that could be able to reach themselves to the closest firebases and survived form bears attack.
•	Failure: show the failure rate, it shows the number of people that died before find and reach to the closest firebase.
•	Firebases: shows the count of firebases on the world.
•	Humans: shows the count of humans on the world.
•	Bears: shows the count of bears on the world.
•	Trees: shows the count of trees on the world.
•	Stones: shows the count of stones on the world.
•	Hour: shows the time.
•	Agents plot: this plot shows in graphical way the numbers of humans, bears and firebases.


#Results:
The goal of this project is to simulate and estimate the rate of success and failure of the people that are trying to reach to the safety zones. The project would also consider how the quantity of people, bears and obstacles and the count of firebases and also the speed of bears and humans would affect the result.
